Testing constructors...
Strings s, s2, s3, s4 have been constructed

s3 = _Zachary
Setting s4 = s3
s4 = _Zachary

Editing s3...
s = Hello World!
s2 = _My name is
s3 = _Zackari
s4 = _Zachary

Size of s3: 8
Size of s2: 11

Reverse of s3 is: irakcaZ_

Index of char 'Z' on s3: 1
Index of char 'i' on s3: 7
Index of char 'l' on s3: -1

Index of pattern, 'World', in s: 6

Is s3 != s4? Yes
Setting s3 = s4
Is s3 == s4? Yes

Is s2 > s? Yes

Is s3 >= s4? 
Yes

Concatenating s2 to s...
s + s2 = Hello World!_My name is

Concatenating s3 to s2 using += operator...
(s + s2) + s3 = _My name is_Zachary

Enter a single-word string and I will tell you it's size
testMySize! 
Size: 10

This concludes testing...
